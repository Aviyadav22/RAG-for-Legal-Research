      "Question: why was the appeal rejected\n",
      "Answer: Based on the context, the appeal was rejected because it was held that an appeal under s. 476B does not lie to this Court (Supreme Court of India) from the decision of a single Judge of a High Court refusing to file a complaint under s. 476 of the Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Court distinguished the case M. S. Sheriff v. The State of Madras, which dealt with an appeal lying to this Court under s. 476B of the Code from an order of a Division Bench of a High Court. Since no appeal lies to the High Court against the decision of a single Judge, and therefore an appeal under s. 476B from an order of the single Judge must lie to the High Court, the present appeal was rejected as it does not lie to this Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the Supreme Court held that the forum of appeal is the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, and not this Court.\n",
